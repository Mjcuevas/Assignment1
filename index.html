<p class="p2"><span class="s2">s3902231@student.rmit.edu.au</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A Website About Me</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Let’s start - Who Am I?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">My name is Mark Jacob Cuevas, but you can just call me MJ.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I am an only child in a family of 3, with both my parents having a full Filipino heritage.</span></p>
<center><img src="myface.jpg"/></center>


<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
My Mother’s name is Maria, and my Father’s is Israel, both grew up in Manila, Philippines.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I, myself, was born in the Philippines but moved to Melbourne, Australia at the age of 4.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>


<p class="p5"><span class="s2">An interesting fact about me is that I am bilingual as I speak both English and Tagalog, </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">speaking Tagalog at home to my parents has helped me retain that part of my culture allowing me to understand my own native tongue. I speak fluently and am able to read, write and understand.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">However, I only ever speak Tagalog at home or to relatives, and I rarely use it outside of the Philippines as my main language I speak is English.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>


<p class="p7"><span class="s2">Hobbies</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">In my free time, I enjoy skating with friends, playing guitar, and watching anime.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">These hobbies such as skating and music interest me, as they provide a challenge and can be very rewarding</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">once I get better. As of now I have only been skating for 4 months and playing guitar for 3 years.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>


<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I also have an interest in anime as the Japanese culture have fun and interesting ways in creating plot and stories that </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">keep the show and characters interesting. The art styles are creative and bring life to the different scenes and their soundtracks</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">have always intrigued my musical background.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>


<p class="p9"><span class="s2">Education to date</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I graduated in 2020, finishing year 12 VCE at Heathdale Christian College, Werribee Campus.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I am currently studying a 3 year Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University as a first year.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><br>


</span><span class="s2">Music</span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s2">In my spare time I like to play and create music.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">My main instrument is the guitar, but I still play other instruments such as the Bass, Keyboard and Harmonica.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I am a self taught guitarist, and have been playing for 3 years now.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I own several guitars, 1 acoustic, 3 electric and 1 Bass.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I have an interest in music and like to produce lo-fi and chill instrumental songs.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s3"><br>



</span><span class="s2">Here are my 2 favourite tracks that I have produced:</span></p>

<p class="p15"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>


<p class="p16"><span class="s2">Interest in IT</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s2">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">My interest in IT is a result of my fascination in the online space and how it operates. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">I was interested in the way information can be stored, received and sent online and the different ways this could be managed.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
My interest in IT recently began in 2020, as I began to explore more about programming, coding and the way the online space worked.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
Recently, the field of IT has seen a higher and increase in demand for professionals, so this was the major reason for me picking this to become my profession.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
The added job security of the IT field, created for an opportunity for me to feel secure about finding work once I had finished my course at RMIT.</span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>


<p class="p19"><span class="s2">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
I chose to come to RMIT as it has been regarded as an excellent university to learn more about one’s interests and has the right facilities </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">and tools that are needed to expand one’s skills in their field of study.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
RMIT has also been recommended to me by many students and their connections to the industry helped with my choice as finding a stable job </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">and developing experience with professionals plays a major role in how I want my future to go.</span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s4"><br>


</span><span class="s2">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">During my course, I expect to learn how to program, code, use database structures and further build my knowledge on the keys ideas, concepts and skills that are required in the world of IT.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">As of now I am interested in cybersecurity, and I expect to learn the ways cybersecurity is used to protect computer operating systems, networks </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">and data from threats such as cyber attacks.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s2"><br>

<center><img src="careers.jpg"/></center>


<p class="p19"><span class="s2">What do the results of these tests mean to you?</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">These results are prone to change as I believe overtime I can change as a person in the way I view things and the way I act, however as of now I can agree with these results as I do enjoy being with others and I acknowledge that I am an extroverted person</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">Although I like being around people, the results from the careers quiz don't reflect the jobs that I have an interest in, as they do not meet my interests and what I want in a job</span></p>



<p class="p19"><span class="s2">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? How should you take this into account when forming a team?</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">These results just reflect that my behaviour in a team is one who is inclusive, efficient and willing to work and listen to others</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">I make sure that when forming a team, everyone is open to new ideas and willing to listening to what others have to say and contribute, despite different opinions</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">In a team, I like to make sure that everyone is treated fairly so that everyone gets a chance to be a part of the team</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Project Idea</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="s2">Overview:</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">My project idea is a phone ‘rhythm game’ that is music themed. I hope to make a game that will be both simple enough for kids to play and challenging enough for adults to master, challenging the player’s sense of rhythm. The game would require players to press buttons in sequence with the beat of the music playing in the background, forcing them to pay attention to the rhythm and constant streams of notes that come their way. </span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="s2">Motivation:</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">This project would be useful as it helps to develop and train skills that may serve as important, such as the motor and cognitive functions within a person. This game can be produced either on Unity for computers or on smartphones as well if not both). Because, with “35.13%” or “2.71 billion” of the world’s population owning a smartphone (and with this number only increasing), I believe that by producing this app on smartphones there is a huge market for all age groups, as now many kids and adults have access to technology, creating a vast audience and greater opportunity for the app to be available for everyone.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">This will also allow players of all skill levels and ages to have a chance to play, as it is not age restricted and open to anyone. I chose this as the popularity of rhythm games has increased significantly especially with games such as “osu!” drawing attention. I am interested in rhythm games as now more and more people are losing motor and cognitive skills, so rhythm games allow for both fun and retraining of these essential skills.</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="s2">Description:</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">The game will be a mobile app that will require users to tap/hold on the screen in correspondence to the music playing in the back. You as the player control the rhythm, tempo and beat, which allows for user creativity and expressiveness, giving the game more life so that it can be replayed over and over again.
  There will also be a community feature that will allow players to form an online community so that they can discuss the games, add one another and see each one another’s profiles. The game will also allow for customized maps, backgrounds and songs that can be downloaded and edited, creating community interactions and a diverse music and song roster. It will include leaderboards and ranks that showcase a player’s abilities and different difficulties so that every player of all skill levels can have a chance to play and improve. 
  
  Offline mode will also be available as there will be songs that are predownloaded onto the device, and other songs can be downloaded as long as the user has connection to the internet and enough storage on their phone. 
  </span></p>

  <p class="p21"><span class="s2">This offline feature will be useful as it will allow them to play the game while on the go, if they want to kill time.
    Split screen will also be an available feature which allows for two users to play with one another on one device. This creates a fun and exciting way for users to test their skills with others such as their friends and see who is the better player out of the two. This split screen will allow for competitiveness creating a more exciting atmosphere, keeping the players on edge and wanting to play more and more in order to see who comes out on top. </span></p>

  <p class="p21"><span class="s2">Mods will be added features to greater challenge players, or create a new experience whether or not they play the same or different songs. These mods include things such as half-time, double-time (speed mods), and darkness which greatly challenge and develop a player’s skills once, forcing them to stay attentive.
    Options that cater to a greater audience such as a colour-blind mode can be added, which enables those that may be visually impaired to play the game without any worries or struggles.</span></p>
    <p class="p21"><span class="s2"> Offline mode will also be available as there will be songs that are predownloaded onto the device, and other songs can be downloaded as long as the user has connection to the internet and enough storage on their phone. This offline feature will be useful as it will allow them to play the game while on the go, if they want to kill time.
      Split screen will also be an available feature which allows for two users to play with one another on one device. This creates a fun and exciting way for users to test their skills with others such as their friends and see who is the better player out of the two. This split screen will allow for competitiveness creating a more exciting atmosphere, keeping the players on edge and wanting to play more and more in order to see who comes out on top. </span></p>
  
<p class="p19"><span class="s2">Tools and Technologies:</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">The tools and technologies required to produce this app would be a laptop or computer with access to the internet and Unity installed. Games built on this engine can be run on PCs, iphones, Androids web browsers and many other platforms.</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="s2">Skills Required:</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">The skills required for the project idea is the ability to use Unity and its game engine program include:</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">The language in unity is called C# so that is also an essential skill needed</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">Experience with scripting, textures, animation, GUI styles, and user session management</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">Familiarity with level design and planning</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">Experience with game physics and particle systems</span></p>


<p class="p19"><span class="s2">Outcome:</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s2">If the project is successful there will be further funding and development to improve any bugs and updates that will be based on user feedback. And if the game becomes popular, that means more people will be having fun while simultaneously training their motor and cognitive skills. 
  The success of the project will also determine the different platforms that the app can be released on, as well as the community and their involvement, which could see a boost in custom maps and a boost in players.
